# Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains detailed documentation about the actual implementation of DevDocAI, including planning documents, architectural decisions, and security implementation details. This is where design meets code.

## Purpose

Implementation documentation bridges the gap between specifications and code by:
- Tracking implementation progress and decisions
- Recording architectural decision rationale
- Documenting security considerations and implementations
- Providing implementation-specific details not covered in specifications
- Capturing lessons learned during development

## Implementation Tracking

### Planning Documents

Planning documents in `/planning` track:
- **Roadmap**: High-level timeline and major milestones
- **Sprint Plans**: Detailed work for each development sprint
- **Task Breakdown**: Decomposition of features into implementable tasks
- **Dependencies**: External libraries, services, and technical dependencies

### Progress Monitoring

Track implementation progress through:

1. **Status Indicators**
   - 🔴 Not Started
   - 🟡 In Progress
   - 🟢 Complete
   - ⚫ Blocked
   - ⚪ Deferred

2. **Completion Metrics**
   - Percentage complete by component
   - Test coverage percentages
   - Documentation coverage
   - Performance benchmarks met

3. **Regular Updates**
   - Weekly progress updates in sprint plans
   - Milestone completion reports
   - Blocker and risk updates

## Decision Documentation

### Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document important technical decisions:

#### ADR Structure
```markdown
# ADR-[number]-[title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?
```

#### When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Selecting between technology options
- Changing architectural patterns
- Making security trade-offs
- Deviating from established patterns
- Making decisions with long-term impact

### Decision Categories

1. **Technology Choices**
   - Programming languages
   - Frameworks and libraries
   - Databases and storage
   - Third-party services

2. **Architectural Patterns**
   - Design patterns
   - Communication protocols
   - Data flow patterns
   - Integration approaches

3. **Security Decisions**
   - Authentication methods
   - Authorization strategies
   - Encryption approaches
   - Compliance requirements

## Security Considerations

### Security Documentation Requirements

All security-related implementation must include:

1. **Threat Model**
   - Asset identification
   - Threat actors
   - Attack vectors
   - Risk assessment

2. **Security Controls**
   - Preventive controls
   - Detective controls
   - Corrective controls
   - Compensating controls

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Encryption algorithms and key management
   - Authentication and session management
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Audit logging and monitoring

### Security Review Process

1. **Design Review**: Security team reviews proposed implementation
2. **Code Review**: Security-focused code review
3. **Testing**: Security testing including penetration testing
4. **Documentation**: Update security documentation
5. **Sign-off**: Security team approval before deployment

## Implementation Best Practices

### DO:
- Document decisions as they are made
- Include context and alternatives considered
- Update documentation when implementation changes
- Link to relevant code and pull requests
- Include performance benchmarks
- Document known limitations

### DON'T:
- Wait until after implementation to document
- Skip documenting "obvious" decisions
- Ignore security implications
- Forget to update status indicators
- Leave TODOs without ownership

## Code-Documentation Synchronization

### Linking Documentation to Code

1. **In Documentation**: Reference specific files, functions, or modules
   ```markdown
   See implementation in `src/auth/jwt-handler.ts`
   ```

2. **In Code**: Reference documentation
   ```javascript
   // See ADR-002 for authentication strategy details
   // Implements security controls from security/controls.md#authentication
   ```

3. **In Commits**: Reference documentation updates
   ```
   feat: implement JWT authentication
   
   - Implements ADR-002 authentication strategy
   - Updates security/controls.md with implementation details
   ```

## Implementation Status Dashboard

### Core Components

| Component | Status | Progress | Test Coverage | Documented |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Authentication | 🟢 | 100% | 95% | ✅ |
| API Gateway | 🟡 | 75% | 80% | ✅ |
| Plugin System | 🟡 | 60% | 70% | ⚠️ |
| Documentation Engine | 🔴 | 10% | 0% | ✅ |

### Current Sprint

**Sprint 15**: August 19-30, 2025
- Focus: Plugin system completion
- Blocked items: 2
- At risk: Performance optimization

## Maintenance

Implementation documentation should be updated:
- With every significant code change
- When architectural decisions are made
- After security reviews
- During sprint planning and review
- When implementation deviates from specification
