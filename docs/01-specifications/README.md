# Specifications Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains all design and technical specifications for the DevDocAI project. These specifications serve as the authoritative source for system requirements, architecture decisions, and API contracts.

## Purpose

Specifications provide the blueprint for implementation, ensuring that:
- All stakeholders have a shared understanding of what will be built
- Implementation aligns with business requirements
- Technical decisions are documented and justified
- Changes can be tracked and versioned appropriately

## Categories of Specifications

### 1. Architecture Specifications

Architecture documents define:
- System boundaries and interfaces
- Component responsibilities and interactions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Scalability and performance considerations
- Security architecture

**Location**: `/architecture`

### 2. API Specifications

API documents provide:
- Endpoint definitions and parameters
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Rate limiting and throttling policies
- Versioning strategy

**Location**: `/api`

### 3. Requirements Documentation

Requirements documents capture:
- Business requirements and objectives
- Functional requirements with acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, usability)
- Constraints and assumptions
- Success metrics and KPIs

**Location**: `/requirements`

## How to Write Specifications

### 1. Use the Appropriate Template

Start with the relevant template from `/00-meta/templates/`:
- `TEMPLATE-design-spec.md` for new features or components
- Use consistent formatting and structure

### 2. Follow the Specification Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review → Approved → Implemented → Deprecated
```

Each specification should include:
- **Status**: Current lifecycle stage
- **Version**: Semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0)
- **Authors**: Who wrote and reviewed the spec
- **Stakeholders**: Who needs to approve changes
- **Dependencies**: Other specs or systems this depends on

### 3. Include Essential Sections

Every specification should contain:

1. **Overview**: What problem does this solve?
2. **Goals & Non-Goals**: What is and isn't in scope
3. **Design/Approach**: How will it work?
4. **Alternatives Considered**: What other approaches were evaluated?
5. **Implementation Plan**: How will it be built?
6. **Testing Strategy**: How will it be validated?
7. **Migration Plan**: How to transition from current state
8. **Risks & Mitigations**: What could go wrong?

### 4. Use Diagrams and Examples

- Include architecture diagrams for complex systems
- Provide API request/response examples
- Show data flow diagrams
- Include sequence diagrams for workflows

## Versioning Strategy

### Version Numbers

Specifications use semantic versioning:
- **Major** (1.0.0): Breaking changes or complete rewrites
- **Minor** (1.1.0): New features or significant updates
- **Patch** (1.1.1): Clarifications or minor corrections

### Change Management

1. **Proposal Stage**: New specs start at version 0.1.0
2. **Review Iterations**: Increment patch version (0.1.1, 0.1.2)
3. **Approval**: Move to 1.0.0
4. **Updates**: Follow semantic versioning rules

### Backward Compatibility

- Specifications should maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Breaking changes require major version bump and migration guide
- Deprecated features should have sunset timeline

## Review Process

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Specification follows the template structure
- [ ] All required sections are complete
- [ ] Technical approach is sound and feasible
- [ ] Security implications are addressed
- [ ] Performance impact is analyzed
- [ ] Testing strategy is comprehensive
- [ ] Migration plan is realistic
- [ ] Risks are identified with mitigations

### Approval Requirements

Different types of specifications require different approvals:

| Type | Required Approvals |
|------|-------------------|
| Architecture | Technical Lead + Product Owner |
| API Changes | API Team + Consuming Teams |
| Requirements | Product Owner + Stakeholders |
| Security | Security Team + Technical Lead |

## Best Practices

### DO:
- Write specifications before implementation
- Keep specifications up-to-date with implementation
- Include concrete examples
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Version all changes

### DON'T:
- Mix implementation details with requirements
- Leave ambiguous requirements
- Skip the alternatives section
- Ignore non-functional requirements
- Forget about backward compatibility
