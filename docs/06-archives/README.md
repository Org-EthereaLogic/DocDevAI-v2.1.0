# Archives - Historical Documentation

## Overview

This directory serves as the historical repository for DevDocAI documentation, preserving previous versions, deprecated features, failed experiments, and lessons learned. Archives provide valuable context for understanding project evolution and preventing repetition of past mistakes.

## Purpose

The archives serve multiple critical functions:
- **Historical Reference**: Preserve the evolution of design decisions and implementations
- **Lessons Learned**: Document what didn't work and why
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintain documentation history for audit purposes
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Retain institutional knowledge as team members change
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring issues and successful solutions
- **Decision Context**: Understand why certain paths were chosen or abandoned

## Archival Policy

### What Gets Archived

1. **Documentation Versions**
   - Previous major versions of specifications
   - Superseded architectural documents
   - Outdated user guides and tutorials

2. **Failed Attempts**
   - Abandoned features and their specifications
   - Unsuccessful architectural approaches
   - Failed optimization attempts

3. **Deprecated Features**
   - API versions being sunset
   - Removed functionality documentation
   - Migration guides from deprecated features

4. **Historical Decisions**
   - Superseded ADRs
   - Changed requirements
   - Pivoted strategies

5. **Quality History**
   - Post-mortem reports
   - Historical performance data
   - Previous security audit results

### When to Archive

Archive documentation when:
- A major version is released (archive previous version)
- A feature is deprecated (archive at deprecation announcement)
- An approach is abandoned (archive immediately with context)
- A security incident occurs (archive post-mortem after resolution)
- A significant refactoring completes (archive pre-refactor state)

### Archive Naming Conventions

```
[DATE]-[TYPE]-[CONTEXT]-[VERSION].[extension]

Examples:
2025-08-23-SPEC-authentication-v1.0.md
2025-07-15-ADR-database-choice-superseded.md
2025-06-01-POSTMORTEM-api-outage.md
```

## How to Access Archived Documents

### Finding Documents

1. **By Date**: Documents are timestamped for chronological browsing
2. **By Type**: Organized into categories (planning, implementation, quality)
3. **By Version**: Version-specific folders for major releases
4. **By Topic**: Use search within archives for specific topics

### Understanding Context

Each archived document should include:
- **Archive Header**: Why it was archived
- **Original Context**: When and why it was created
- **Deprecation Note**: What replaced it
- **Lessons Learned**: Key takeaways

Example header:
```markdown
---
ARCHIVED: 2025-08-23
REASON: Superseded by v2.0 architecture
REPLACED BY: /01-specifications/architecture/v2.0/
LESSONS LEARNED: Microservices approach was overly complex for our scale
---
```

## Lessons Learned Storage

### Structure for Lessons Learned

```markdown
# Lesson: [Brief Title]

## Context
What was being attempted and why?

## What Happened
Detailed description of the issue or discovery

## Root Cause
Why did this occur?

## Impact
What was affected and how severely?

## Resolution

## Historical Reference

### Version History Tracking

Maintain clear version genealogy:

```
v1.0 (2024-01) - Initial release
  ├── v1.1 (2024-03) - Bug fixes
  ├── v1.2 (2024-06) - Performance improvements
  └── v1.3 (2024-09) - Security patches
  
v2.0 (2024-12) - Major refactor
  ├── v2.1 (2025-03) - New plugin system
  └── v2.2 (2025-06) - API v2
  
v3.0 (2025-08) - Current version
```

### Migration Documentation

For each major version transition, archive:
1. Migration guides
2. Breaking changes documentation
3. Compatibility matrices
4. Rollback procedures
5. Data migration scripts

## Archive Maintenance

### Regular Reviews

- **Quarterly**: Review recent additions for completeness
- **Annually**: Consolidate lessons learned
- **Per Release**: Archive superseded documentation

### Retention Policy

| Document Type | Retention Period | Reason |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Major Version Docs | Indefinite | Historical reference |
| Minor Version Docs | 2 years | Support overlap |
| Post-Mortems | Indefinite | Learning value |
| Failed Experiments | 5 years | Pattern recognition |
| Test Results | 1 year | Trend analysis |
| Security Audits | 7 years | Compliance |

### Archive Compression

For older archives:
1. Compress documentation older than 1 year
2. Create indexed summaries for quick reference
3. Maintain searchable metadata
4. Store in cold storage if appropriate

## Using Archives Effectively

### For New Team Members

- Demonstrating learned best practices

### For Decision Making

Reference archives to:
- Avoid repeating past mistakes
- Understand historical context
- Build on previous work
- Justify new approaches

### For Compliance

Archives provide:
- Audit trail of changes
